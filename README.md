Overview
This repository contains Python code for analyzing neural data. I'm building computational skills for neuroscience research as I prepare to apply to graduate programs in computational neuroscience.
About This Project
I'm a 2nd-year BSc Neuroscience with Psychology student at University of Sussex. This portfolio demonstrates my developing skills in:

Python programming for data analysis
Neuroscience data visualization
Computational approaches to understanding neural activity

Current Projects
Project 1: Neural Spike Train Analysis ✅
Status: Complete (January 2026)
Analysis of simulated neural spike trains, including:

Spike detection and visualization
Firing rate calculations
Raster plots
Statistical analysis of neural activity

Key Techniques:

Poisson process simulation
Time-binned firing rate analysis
Data visualization with matplotlib

Future Projects (Planned)

Project 2: Real neural data analysis using public datasets (Feb-Mar 2026)
Project 3: Computational neuron models (Summer 2026)
Project 4: Machine learning applications to neuroscience (Autumn 2026)

Technologies

Python 3.x
NumPy - Numerical computations
Matplotlib - Data visualization
SciPy - Statistical analysis
